Last known well 10AM this morning (on 2/16). Pt was then seen in the evening by his family around 8:45PM, where he was found down in his apartment. Transferred initially to Norwood Hospital.  ?  At Norwood, pt found to have L sided hemiparesis, dysarthria, L facial droop, R gaze deviation. CT/CTA demonstrated R ICA occlusion extending into M1 and A1 on R side, already evidence of developing infarct in MCA territory on CT (ASPECT reportedly 6). Transferred to BMC for possible thrombectomy, did not receive tpa.  ?  On arrival to BMC on 2/17/2020, pt afebrile, HR 70s, BP 200/99, SpO2 95% on RA. Labs notable for glucose 109, INR 0.95, lactate 1.2, WBC 12.4.?Repeat CT/CTA/CT perfusion at BMC demonstrated R ICA occlusion, dense R MCA sign, large area of ischemic core within the right MCA territory with ASPECT of 4. Decision made to forgo thrombectomy given low ASPECT score, admitted to SICU for further management.  ?  Initial ICU Course:   Neurosurgery was consulted when Mr. Hasenfus was admitted to the Neuro ICU for possible hemicraniectomy. He developed some crowding of the ambient cisterns but otherwise was doing well. During his ICU stay a stroke work up had been done which showed an A1c at goal, 6.1, and an LDL of 143. A TTE showed normal EF 60%, no obvious regional wall motion abnormalities, no evidence of interatrial shunt. On 2/21 given that he had not yet developed significant malignant edema he was started on aspirin 81mg daily and transferred to the stroke stepdown service. He developed more lethargy overnight n stepdown, stopped following commands and required transfer back to the neuro ICU on 2/22/2020. He was started on hypertonic saline boluses for edema with midline shift of 2mm to the left. This remained stable and his hypertonic saline boluses were stopped again on 2/24. His sodium was managed with oral salt tabs 2g TID then 1g TID thereafter. A PEG was placed on 2/27/2020.  A TEE was ordered for completion of work up of his stroke etiology but not done because it would require intubation and he would have difficulty weaning from the vent. MRI was also not done because of concern that laying flat would exacerbate his edema from his stroke, so it was deferred during his ICU course. He remained stable for the remainder of his ICU course and was transferred to the Stroke floor again on 3/1/2020.  ?  Stroke Floor Course  He had an uneventful first day out of the ICU but then overnight from 3/1-2 he developed a fever to 103F, rigors, and had right sided pain. Blood cultures, urinalysis, chest xray, sputum culture and labs were sent. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime for broad spectrum coverage. He was also ordered for four limb dopplers to look for DVT. His infectious work up ultimately returned negative, but he was found to have an acute right upper extremity DVT around a PICC line. The PICC was removed. He was started on a heparin gtt for DVT then transitioned to apixaban for DVT treatment on 3/11/2020 for goal 3 months of treatment. Vanc/cefepime was discontinued without recurrence of fever. Aspirin was discontinued due to being on apixaban, but once the 3 month course for provoked DVT is completed, aspirin 81mg daily should be resumed.  ?  Once stabilized from a fever and DVT standpoint, Mr. Hasenfus was finally able to obtain an MRI to evaluate his etiology of stroke further. MRI brain, MRA head and neck, vessel wall imaging, and MRV of the head was all done. Unfortunately the vessel wall imaging was nondiagnostic in the setting of patient motion, therefore it remains unknown if patient had a dissection as the cause of his carotid occlusion or not. The MRV was also unremarkable (obtained because of the RUE DVT to make sure it did not extend newly into the intracranial venous system- which, it did not). MRI brain with MRA head and neck showed acute infarct in the right MCA territory with cytotoxic and vasogenic edema and mild mass effect but no significant midline shift. Multiple small petechial hemorrhages are seen within the area of the infarct. MRA showed segmental occlusion of the proximal right ICA just down the carotid bifurcation with reconstitution but overal diminutive caliber of the majority of the cervical right ICA.There was also a focal area of moderate to severe narrowing of the origine of the M2 segment of the left MCA and moderate to severe stenosis of the intracranial left vertebral artery. Overall, patient with R ICA occlusion with large R MCA infarct. Suspect atherosclerosis, but dissection also a possibility given recent fall, but unable to prove given MRI nondiagnostic.  ?  While inpatient he was assessed by PT and OT who recommended discharge to acute rehab. Additionally was followed by SLP, who upgraded him from tube feeds only diet to puree with nectar thick once he passed a FEES. PEG remains in place if patient fails to meet caloric needs.  ?  Of note, patient with a history of alcohol use disorder. No evidence of withdrawal while inpatient. Managed with thiamine 100mg daily and multivitamin daily and discharged on this.  ?  Patient also had hyponatremia while admitted. Salt tabs were weaned to 1g TID but had to go back to 2g TID on 3/6 for fall in sodium by 6, from 140 to 134 over 48 hours. Should continue trying to wean off as an outpatient for goal normal sodium 135-145 with intermittent sodium checks at rehab.  ?",NA,2,NA,NA,0,2020-02-16 23:15:00,NA,3.5,2020-02-23 08:07:00,6,1,1,2020-02-22 04:00:00,0,2020-02-22 04:00:00,2020-02-17 10:29:00,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,138,138,484.733333333333,NA,24.4833333333333,NA,NA,NA,125.5,125.5,472.233333333333,NA,11.9833333333333,1583009220,2020-02-22 04:00:00,138,125.5,14,0

Imaging also revealed cerebral and bone metastases, and segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Given that repeat head imaging was stable without enlargement of the SAH, heparin was started for treatment of the pulmonary emboli. As a part of stroke workup, a TTE also found a large and highly mobile tricuspid valve vegetation. Though the patient had leukocytosis, she was afebrile with negative blood cultures so it was thought that the vegetation was due to NBTE or, less likely, a metastasis. The hospital course was complicated by DIC, dysphagia, and likely recurrent aspiration.   ˇ  Overall, the patient has a poor prognosis from her widely metastatic cancer, severe deficits in wakefulness and speech from bilateral CVAs, and multiple other serious comorbid conditions, particularly multiple PE and a large tricuspid valve vegetation. Goals of care discussions were held with the neurology team, oncology team, and patient's family.

Hospital course further c/b NSTEMI, new dx of HFrEF (35%), ATN, hemoptysis, and GI bleed. She was with prolonged intubation and after multiple goals of care discussions it was decided to pursue tracheostomy. She underwent tracheostomy placement on 2/28/2022 with trauma surgery. Her tracheostomy was noted to be extremely positional leading to high PIPs when she flexes her neck or turns her head to the side due to airway collapse. This was thought to be in the setting of tracheomalacia from prolonged ventilator dependence. It was noted at that time that due to her anatomy she requires a long tracheostomy tube, however, her small trachea precludes her from the standard sizing carried in the hospital. Given this tracheostomy tube needed to be ordered specially, the decision was made to reintubate the patient to prevent airway collapse. Intubation was successfully performed the morning of 3/1/2022. Patient was maintained on the ventilator with medication for pain and sedation without issues while awaiting custom tracheostomy tube. Patient went to the OR on 3/7/2022 with ENT for revision tracheostomy. The prior tracheostomy was visualized laterally at the level of the cricoid, therefore, a new tracheostomy was made inferiorly with bjork flap sutured to skin. There were no immediate complications and the patient returned to the MICU after the procedure. Overnight after the procedure, patient was noted to be more tachypneic and more tachycardic. Labs drawn at that time were significant for new hyperkalemia and new anion gap metabolic acidosis. She was found to have an elevated lactate to 11. Given high concern for organ ischemia in the setting of persistently elevated lactate without clear etiology, patient underwent imaging of her neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis. This was significant for oblong peripherally enhancing collection of fluid and gas in the mediastinum which may communicate with the esophagus as in a contained esophageal perforation, extensive intraluminal and intramural gas within the bladder with circumferential wall thickening and extensive pericystic fat stranding highly suggestive of emphysematous cystitis and nonspecific bowel wall edema in the hepatic flexure of the colon. Anesthesia confirmed that there were no episodes of hypotension during the tracheostomy procedure. Thoracic surgery was consulted and felt that imaging findings were consistent with an irregularly-shaped patulous esophagus and recommended esophagram to further assess for potential esophageal perforation. Throughout the day, patient had persistent hyperkalemia despite critical care insulin infusion requiring initiation of hemodialysis. She underwent a successful hemodialysis session, however, lactate remained elevated. She was found to have a rising troponin and cardiology was consulted and felt this was in the setting of demand ischemia.

He has Barrett's esophagus. He is active without dementia, and he continues to work. Today at 4:00 PM  in fell in the bathroom His family heard him and found him unable to speak with right-sided weakness. EMTs found him with forced leftward gaze deviation and dense right hemiplegia. He was brought to Good Samaritan Hospital where he was in sinus rhythm with BP 125/64. He was aphasic with leftward gaze deviation and dense right hemiplegia. Head CT showed no hemorrhage and no findings of acute infarct,  ASPECTS = 10. There is a suggesting of possible hyperdense sign at the top of the left  ICA and into the left M1. CTA showed atherosclerotic changes with dropout of flow in the left ICA. There is faintly visible luminal contrast up to the petrous ICA then none through the terminus and M1 and proximal A1 segments. There is poor collateral flow in the MCA branches.  No IV tPA was given, because the family reported that he had had GI bleeding last week, thought to be due to Barrett's esophagus. He was transferred to BMC by MedFlight for urgent endovascular thrombectomy. Dr. Nguyen is performing the DSA.

Subsequent stability CT scans revealed progressive cerebral edema and midline shift (hitting maximum of 1cm of midline shift), although examination remained stable despite this swelling. Blood pressure control was gradually tightened over the course of her time in the ICU, allowing for reinitiation of her home Metoprolol, Amlodipine and Lisinopril. Hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. Once her stability imaging indicated a halt in the progression of her cerebral edema, she was transferred out of the intensive care unit.  ˇ  Since her departure from the ICU, the workup of her stroke has been largely unrevealing; transthoracic echocardiogram did not reveal an intracardiac thrombus, significant atriapathy, or patent foramen ovale. A possible L ventricular aneurism was found but the finding was not confirmed on the trans esophageal echocardiogram. For this finding, T. Cruzi ab were sent, and resulted negative. Telemetry monitoring has not revealed an occult arrhythmia. LDL was 164, prompting initiation of high-intensity statin therapy. Hemoglobin A1c was 5.4%. Vessel imaging did not reveal a large vessel atherosclerotic plaque that lends itself well to being a source for artery-to-artery embolism.

She underwent a TEE and DCCV prior to discharge and was prescribed apixaban 5mg BID. She was seen by the neurology service on 2/20 for an episode of dizziness when she was admitted. At that time she was evaluated for a room spinning sensation that was not positional, and was thought to be recurrent. She reported no other neurological signs at that time, and the exam was notable only for a wide-based gait, but was otherwise nonfocal. She underwent an MRI which had no findings concerning for stroke. At that time the unsteady gait with a new finding of A. fib was concerning for an MRI negative stroke, and she was recommended to start atorvastatin 80 mg and cardiology was consulted to opine on the management of A. Fib/anticoagulation. During that admission LDL 200, A1c 5.2.  She had no social history of alcohol use, tobacco use or any other drugs.  She worked as a nurse and was functionally independent at baseline, prior to this episode.     Today, the patient was brought in by EMS with an unclear last known well. Her roommate reporting to EMS, and she was last seen well at around 11 AM, but this could not be confirmed with any collateral information. Additionally her last dose of apixaban was on 2/25 prior to discharge from the hospital.      On my evaluation, the patient was nonverbal, in a c-collar, with a left gaze, aphasic, with a plegic left upper and lower extremity with an overall presentation concerning for left MCA syndrome.     Given her recent apixaban use, she was not eligible for TPA therapy, on review of the CT/CTA she was found to have a hyperdense left MCA sign and the IR team was promptly contacted to attempt a mechanical thrombectomy.     I briefly updated her daughter Gabriel Francis 754-269-3075 and she was later updated by the stroke fellow Dr. Lalla that her mother was having a stroke and was undergoing a procedure to attempt to retrieve the blood clot.

Called EMS and then presented to an outside hospital where he was found to be in a tachyarrhythmia, ?wide complex tachycardia but did not require cardioversion. Noted to have increased troponin. At OSH pt reportedly had a 'nonfocal exam' was transferred to Holy Family ICU for consideration of cardiac cath. HCT at Holy Family was initially wnl.  Around 11-11:30AM, he was found to have a left facial droop and was not moving his left side. At that point, CT/CTA obtained which demonstrated R M2 occlusion, ASPECT 10, decision via telestroke at OSH not to give ta given no clear last known well.

NIHSS unable to be obtained on arrival to BMC.  IR atempted thrombectomy via Right fem, then right radial - patient was HD unstable and he had additional thrombi during the procedure. As team was preparing for additional pass, when pt became hypoxemic and Anes was called for intubation. Intra op Echo revealing EF -20%, global hypokinesis.  Per IR note: 'Upon arrival the patient was noted to be very hypotensive and there was difficulty obtaining up pressure by cuff. We attempted right femoral access but could not try the catheter and therefore utilized right radial access for the thrombectomy. The patient was found to have a right M2 occlusion but did have additional thrombus noted during the procedure and final recanalization was consistent with a right M1 occlusion. Due to significant hypoxemia he required endotracheal intubation by anesthesia and due to difficulty with ventilating we were not able to pursue additional passes beyond 2 passes due to hemodynamic instability. Three-dimensional rotational Fluoroscopy did not show any definitive intracranial hemorrhage after the procedure with the limitations of its resolution.'  He is now admitted to the cardiac ICU for further monitoring due to significant cardiopulmonary instability. Upon arrival to the CCU, pt was on max vent setting with PEEP 10 -> 15 and FiO2 100.

She was found to have a R M1 occlusion thought to be cardioembolic in the setting of atrial fibrillation with apixaban noncompliance. No TPA given since she was out of the window and no MT attempted due to low ASPECTS score.  ˇ  Her hospital course has been prolonged and complicated by respiratory failure and dysphagia now s/p trach + G tube converted to GJ tube (11/29/22), refractory atrial fibrillation with RVR requiring addition of digoxin to her home metoprolol rate control regimen, tachy-brady syndrome with consideration of pacemaker for sustained bradycardia, but patient was not stable for this procedure. She also had multiple aspiration events requiring vent support and treatment of pseudomonas HAP, Klebsiella HAP s/p treatment with ceftriaxone, and ear pain with otoscopic exam showing cerumen impaction managed with carbamide peroxide ear drops. Lastly, she required a second ICU admission due to a cluster of seizures with R arm and leg shaking with EEG correlate, now controlled on Keppra 1250 -> 1000 mg BID.  ˇ  She was transferred back to the ICU on 4/18/22 due to worsening respiratory status, fevers, and hypotension, found to be in septic shock due to polymicrobial bacteremia 2/2 UTI with klebsiella and enteroccocus, treated with cefiderocol narrowed to ceftriaxone as well as ampicillin. Blood cultures were trended until they were clear. ICU course was also complicated by LUE cellulitis s/p 5 days of vancomycin as well as acute on chronic HFpEF exacerbation c/b contraction metabolic alkalosis due to excessive third spacing with chronic hypoalbuminemia that was treated with diamox and lasix for diuresis. She required pressors and mechanical ventilation upon re-admission to ICU, and was eventually weaned off pressors but required mechanical ventilation due to pulmonary edema from volume overload that was eventually weaned off on 5/2/2023. She was discharged in stable condition.   ˇ  Problem Course:  #R MCA stroke (R M1 occlusion)  On presentation on 11/19/22, patient went to bed at 9 PM and woke up at midnight with left sided weakness that was new and worse despite her prior R MCA stroke. This occurred in the setting of stopping her home apixaban. No TPA given out of window and no MT attempted given low ASPECTS score. MRI/MRA on 11/23/22 showed edema and midline shift. She required intubation due to poor mental status in the ICU, and due to failed SBT, required eventual trach. She also had persistent dysphagia due to her large stroke, and required G tube that was eventually converted to a GJ tube. She was initially placed on a heparin gtt and restarted on her home apixaban 5 mg BID (increased from 2.5 mg BID given increased weight >60 kg now). Etiology of stroke presumed cardioembolic due to missed AC with atrial fibrillation. TTE showed LVEF >80% and no PFO. ILR not placed given known atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation. For risk factor mangaement, patient was continued on her home BP regimen and atorvastatin for goal LDL <70.  ˇ  #Seizures  Initial event on 3/1/23. Semiology of R leg --> arm shaking, head turn to right and left gaze deviation. S/p Keppra 3.5 g load and started on 1 g BID. Transferred to the ICU, where a similar event was captured on EEG on 3/2/23 with note of left 2 hz spikes, likely representing a focal seizure arising form a deep focus. No clear provoking infection and repeat MRI without apparent left sided focus (known R MCA stroke would not be causing this semiology), however on our review there does appear to be potential hippocampal sclerosis/temporal atrophy.   - Keppra was started and gradually increased to 1250 mg -> 1000 mg BID and there were no further events.  ˇ  #Afib with RVR  #Tachybrady syndrome  Increasing periods of Afib with RVR so cardiology was consulted and digoxin was started. She also had ongoing issues concerning for tachy-brady syndrome, with heart rates at minimum of high 30s, and at other times afib with RVR up to 170s. Cardiology did not feel that digoxin would worsen the bradycardia, and frequent adjustments / holdings were made for metoprolol. Cardiology suggested possibility of pacemaker should sustained bradycardia continue to be a problem, but patient was generally not sufficiently stable for such a procedure. Eventually, patient had stable rate/rhythm control on digoxin 0.125 mg daily and metoprolol 25 mg Q6H.  ˇ  #Acute on chronic HFpEF  Volume overloaded. BNP 768 (4/23) -> 603 (4/27).

She presented to Lawrence General Hospital, where cardiac catheterization revealed multi-vessel disease requiring coronary artery bypass grafting. She was placed on a heparin infusion and transferred to St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, where she underwent four vessel CABG on 5/26; she continues to have bilateral chest tubes in place. She was started on standing diuretics for volume management and she was able to maintain her oxygen saturation on minimal supplemental oxygen. Otherwise, it does not appear that she had major post-operative complications (there were small bilateral pleural effusions visualized on post-operative plain films of the chest that have since resolved).     Ms. Ortiz was last seen at her neurologic baseline at approximately 4:15 AM this morning, when she ambulated with nursing to the restroom. She was subsequently discovered around 8:00 AM to be having difficulty moving her left side and slurring her speech, prompting concern for acute ischemic stroke. Her initial NIH Stroke Scale was approximately 28, scoring for four limb weakness, left facial droop, right gaze deviation, and a left homonymous hemianopia. Initial imaging workup was notable for an occlusion of the superior M2 division of the right middle cerebral artery within the Sylvian fissure; a non-contrast head CT performed at the same time revealed evidence of ischemia/infarction within the territory supplied by that vessel (ASPECTS of 4). She had concomitant hypoxemia prompting administration of intravenous furosemide (reportedly with good effect).

Outside window for TNK and not a mechanical thrombectomy candidate as the infarct appears completed. Transferred to BMC for management of cerebral edema.  ÔøΩ  He was treated briefly with hypertonic saline for cerebral edema which has resolved. There was no neurosurgical intervention offered for his infarct and edema. He remains in the neuro ICU weaning from the ventilator while being treated with IV antibiotics for endocarditis. His diuresis is difficult given soft blood pressures so midodrine was added to assist. He has also developed constipation with a stool ball and large stool burden which is likely from lack of movement and pain medications. He remains on standing oxycodone as he was on a fentanyl gtt long term to prevent withdrawal. The stool ball has resolved but stool burden remains so lactulose via PEG and enema was continued for an additional 24 hours. Given he has no neurological issues to manage a MICU consult was requested for further management. He has a court date later in December which will aid in changing his code status and possibly transition to CMO.",NA,1,2023-11-09 07:55:00,2023-11-10 05:37:00,9.1,2023-11-14 04:13:00,NA,2.44,2023-11-11 11:06:00,10,0,0,NA,0,NA,2023-11-04 12:05:00,2023-11-09 07:55:00,2023-11-10 05:37:00,NA,1,0,1,1,0,0,NA,21.9166666666667,NA,NA,NA,NA,677.833333333333,NA,-93.9166666666667,3.03333333333333,NA,NA,NA,NA,658.95,NA,-112.8,1700511480,2023-11-20 20:19:00,298.316666666667,279.433333333333,6,1
